      <h2>Is it safe for me to exercise during pregnancy?</h2>
      <p>
        Both the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and American College of Sports Medicine list a
        number of benefits for engaging in physical activity whilst pregnant compared to those doing no exercise. I am
        also a fully qualified pre and postnatal fitness specialist trained to know how to adapt exercises for you. I
        have the latest information and research to ensure your sessions are safe for you.
      </p>

    <article class="faq-item">
      <h2>Should I tell you as soon as I know I'm pregnant or can I wait until later?</h2>
      <p>
        You can tell me whichever feels right and comfortable to you. If you tell me early on in your pregnancy be
        rest assured that this will stay completely confidential. The sooner you tell me you are expecting, the earlier
        I can look after you and give you options safe for each trimester.
      </p>
    </article>
    
    <article class="faq-item">
      <h2>Should I speak to my midwife/health professional about exercising whilst pregnant?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes. You should always speak to your health professional about wanting to exercise. They have your detailed
        medical history and can advise you if there are any precautions you need to take.
      </p>
    </article>
    
    <article class="faq-item">
      <h2>Can I eat extra during pregnancy?</h2>
      <p>
        Although the old wives tale says you are eating for two.. unfortunately this isn't true. In your third
        trimester you can eat 200 extra calories and 500 more if you breastfeed after birth. This will help you with a
        healthy maternal weight gain. You can find my leaflet for nutrition during pregnancy <a
          href="images/Nutrition Leaflet.pdf" download>here</a>
      </p>
    </article>
    
    <article class="faq-item">
      <h2>I haven't exercised prior to being pregnancy, can I still attend Bumps?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes! We will build this up in a gradual progression up to 30 minutes per day. I will give you extra breaks to
        ensure you build this up safely. Pregnancy is a time for maintaining fitness levels rather than improving them
        but if you have not exercised prior to pregnancy then these will improve for you. This can help you with stamina
        for labour, help keep your body supple and flexible as your progress in your pregnancy and help with postnatal
        recovery.
      </p>
    </article>
    
    <article class="faq-item">
      <h2>When can I start exercising again after birth?</h2>
      <p>
        Minimum 6 weeks after a vaginal delivery. Minimum 12 weeks after a caesarean delivery. You should always get
        the go ahead from your health professional before restarting exercise too. They can check you have healed
        sufficiently prior to resuming exercising.
      </p>
    </article>
    
    <article class="faq-item">
      <h2>I'm breastfeeding can I still exercise?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes! I will adapt exercises to help avoid soreness and pressure on your breasts. If baby is present during
        the workout, feed away! There are no judgements here and breastfeeding is always welcomed during the class.
      </p>
    </article>
    
    <article class="faq-item">
      <h2>Can I bring my baby to the sessions?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes! This is one of the reasons I set up my postnatal classes. As a mum myself I found it hard to get to
        classes that allowed my baby to come with me, where feeding is normal and it's understood that babies can be
        fussy sometimes! If your baby is a precrawler you are welcome to pop them on a mat/ blanket whilst you do the
        class. If they are a mover please pop them in a carrier or pram. This will help you get the most out of your
        session without running round after a little hurricane!

    <article class="faq-item">
      <h2>I don't know if I have diastasis recti. Will we check for this?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes. We will do a diastasis recti check at the start of the course and movements will be chosen to help knit
        back your abdominals after birth.
      </p>
    </article>
    
    <article class="faq-item">
      <h2>When can I attend baby massage?</h2>
      <p>
        You can attend baby massage from baby being as little as 8 weeks. All techniques used are safe from this age and we make sure to use fractionated coconut oil so not upset little skin.
      </p>
    </article>
    
    <article class="faq-item">
      <h2>Are doulas only for home births?</h2>
      <p>
        No doulas can support you in any birth setting. Be that home or hospital, vaginal or caesarean. We are a non judgemental, supportive presence in your birth journey that you can call upon to discuss options and interventions, provide alternative birthing positions, have a constant support during multiple shift changes or of your birth partner needs to eat, sleep or use the toilet and provide that calm and comforting support when you need it most. Doulas are not medical but can provide you with evidence based information to help you make choices that you are comfortable with for both you and your baby.
