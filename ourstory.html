                <h1>Our Story</h1>
                <p>
                    Eir and Wild wellness [pronounced Air & Wild] was created to combine my previously separate offerings of Fitness with Lara
                    (my regular fitness sessions) and Baby. Body. Beautiful. (My pre and postnatal specialisms). I
                    wanted to create a single empowering yet supportive space for the whole of the womanhood journey,
                    be it fitness and/or motherhood, and so Eir and Wild wellness was born. Where you: Awaken your
                    power. Nurture your journey.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The name comes from: Eir who is a Norse healing and mercy goddess, symbolising healing, protection
                    and care with a powerful feminine energy. Something I always want to provide during my sessions.
                    Wild is pretty self explanatory! Freedom to be yourself, not tied by societal pressure and an
                    untamed spirit. Together they provide a soft but fierce energy just like womanhood and motherhood.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have been to any of my classes before you will know that there is never any talk of size,
                    shape or body image, which I find is even more important when little ears are around. I have felt
                    the body image pressure of social media and tabloids, especially with the bounce back culture after
                    having Luna, and I want to avoid bringing that to any of my sessions. After all, there is so much
                    more to fitness than fitting in a single box for society. Mental and physical health, enjoyment of
                    moving your body and socialising with other women on their journey are just to name a few!
                </p>
                <p>
                    So if you are looking for a safe, empowering, non judgemental, motivating, supportive, friendly
                    space for your womanhood journey, then Eir and Wild wellness is for you.
                </p>
