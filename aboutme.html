            <h3>Lara Bailey</h3>
            <p>
                Hi I’m Lara! I’m 34, wife to Dan (also known as our tech whizz) and mum to our beautiful daughter Luna.
                I’m a lover of fitness and women’s wellness, babies, pregnancies and birth as well as all things
                celestial, crystals and mystical. I’m always on hand with a supportive word, a listening ear, a
                shoulder to cry on or a woo at your achievements! Whatever you need, I’m your girl!
            </p>
            <p>
                You will normally recognise me from the rainbow hair which I’ve had for about 10 years now. It changes
                often though, so I’m never one colour for a long time! If you have little ones, I apologise for the
                questions of how to get those colours that often ensue too!
            </p>
            <p>
                I have a couple of autoimmune conditions under my belt as well as a bowel condition. So if you are
                attending with some of these too, I feel you and understand. I’ll always make sure you are checking in
                with your body too, after all you know it best! We have also lost 2 pregnancies in 2023 and 2024, so if
                you are joining my motherhood journey classes and are having some anxiety after loss or during a
                fertility journey, I can fully empathise and will always have a listening ear.
            </p>

                <h3>Fitness Career</h3>
                <p>
                    I trained to be a fitness instructor when I was 18 and have been helping people on their fitness
                    journeys ever since! I initially trained in group fitness which is why I love classes so much and
                    quickly went on to train in various Les Mills programmes (6 to be exact) where I was also chosen
                    to be a tribe coach, supporting new instructors through their teaching journeys. I also trained in
                    group indoor cycling, Zumba, Zumbatomic, INSANITY and aqua aerobics just to name a few. I completed
                    my Personal training qualification not long after this and have been training clients on a 1:1 basis
                    for well over 10 years now. I love being able to connect with clients on a personal basis whilst
                    also helping them achieve their specific goals. I’ll chat during your sessions, but I know how to
                    push those workouts for you!
                </p>

            <h3>Pre &amp; Postnatal</h3>
            <p>
                Despite being in fitness for so long, I did not specialise in pre and postnatal fitness until having
                Luna. In 2020, I took the leap and finally did my training course through lockdown. I felt after
                experiencing pregnancy and postnatal recovery I was better equipped to help my clients, as I have been
                through some of the same things they will be feeling.
            </p>
            <p>
                I trained throughout my pregnancy. Throughout the early morning sickness nausea when no one but our
                close family knew, right through to 36 weeks when I stopped incase I went into labour mid class however
                I still trained my last PT client 4 days before my due date! I honestly feel keeping my fitness levels
                up helped me lead a happy and healthy pregnancy along with helping my postnatal recovery after an
                emergency Caesarean birth.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am fully qualified to create fitness programmes for both prenatal clients from first trimester to
                third and postnatal clients juggling new motherhood. I can also give nutritional advice alongside the
                sessions to help you lead a fit and healthy pre and postnatal journey. You can be rest assured that
                the sessions are held with the latest medical guidance and are safe for each trimester. Options during
                sessions will change depending on what trimester you are in, be it first or fourth!

            <h3>Supporting Motherhood</h3>
            <p>
                I completed my baby massage training as I knew I wanted to help support parents and babies to connect
                and bond even further after my own experiences practising baby massage with Luna. I found how the
                benefits of massage can help promote sleep in little ones, ease tummy aches and release tension as well
                as promote bonding with touch and singing. It also wanted to create a safe space to be heard, nurtured
                and supported postpartum and found this calming space with small groups is the perfect place for this.
            </p>
            <p>
                I completed my Doula training in 2022 with the Every Birth Matters course. It is something I have
                wanted to do for a while, but waiting for the right course at the right time was important to me so
                when this one came along I took the leap and started my training. This included pre coursework, live
                and online training, post coursework all of which I have passed and am now certified. I am now
                completing extra training in a mentorship with my course tutor Katy. This means I can gain extra
                knowledge after the course to further help in your birth, labour and postnatal journey. It also means
                you get 2 doulas for the price of one as I always have back up on the phone should something
                unexpected arise, as well as getting a discounted price whilst I complete this extra training. Upon
                completing my training I also participated in an extra hypnobirthing skills workshop to help assist
                mums to be and their partners further.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am however, currently taking a break from this due to navigating our own fertility journey, however
                my knowledge is always on hand during sessions so ask away! I’m always here to help!
